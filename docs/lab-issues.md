For all lab issues that are not related to login problems, the primary channel for getting further information is our [Lab Support Slack channel](https://kodekloud.slack.com/archives/C045CAW4PJP), so this is where you should go for further information and status updates.

## Unable to access labs from Udemy course

We provide a free enrolment coupon for labs on the Udemy courses. Please check the steps here: https://support.kodekloud.com/udemy-students-unable-to-access-labs

If you are still having an issue, please get in touch with the support team: support@kodekloud.com

## Question options are all marked incorrect

This is an intermittent issue. In such cases, please reload the browser page and redo the question. You don't need to stop/reset the lab. After reloading, it should pick up where you left off. So you can select the correct option for this question again and it should work.

Should this fail to resolve the issue, please report in our [Lab Support Slack channel](https://kodekloud.slack.com/archives/C045CAW4PJP), including a link to the lab and the question number.

## Labs Disconnecting/Crashing

You're probably reading this because you've experienced labs that are crashing, not loading, giving nginx error codes, slow or other similar reasons.

We are really sorry that you are experiencing this, however you must understand a few things. If you are successful in fulfilling a career in DevOps, these sorts of issues will become very familiar to you and is all in the day in the life of a DevOps engineer!

First off, let's rule out any potential browser issues. If you are new to the labs, this could be the issue. Please read and try out the tips here: https://support.kodekloud.com/troubleshooting-labs

If the labs are still not working, there are a number of reasons this may be happening. To provide the labs, we rely on Cloud-based infrastructure and various other third party services, such as content distribution network (CDN) providers and the like which are not under our control. Any of these pieces in the puzzle could be having an issue, meaning that if it is not something under our control, we all have to wait until the third party fixes their issue.

If you are in the middle of a lab and the terminal screen shows an nginx 404/502/504 error or a "connection closed" error, then sometimes this can clear by opening a new terminal tab after a minute or so.

Additionally, we have tens of thousands of students doing courses at any one time. There is only so much infrastructure to go round. It may be that you've hit a busy time, so you should wait a few minutes and retry. If still broken, wait a few hours before retrying. Even Cloud providers (which we rely on) have periods where infrastructure cannot be provisioned due to excessive demand. Issues may also be regional. What works for a user in one part of the world may not work in another. This can be attributed to regional third parry services such as CDN or Cloud Provider issues (outside our direct control).

When it is the case that the issue is with our own platform or infrastructure, or if we know where the cause is elsewhere, there will generally be announcements made on our [Lab Support Slack channel](https://kodekloud.slack.com/archives/C045CAW4PJP), so you should  check there for updates and fix ETAs.

Either way, you should try reloading the lab immediately, after a few minutes and if that does not work, after an hour or so.

All lab issues raised via our Userback feedback system (small blue box containing speech bubble to the right of the screen) are moved to a special queue that helps us track the type and frequency of such issues.

The key takeaway from this is that the issues you may be facing are not always something that is our fault, therefore not something that can be fixed immediately.

We thank you for your patience.
