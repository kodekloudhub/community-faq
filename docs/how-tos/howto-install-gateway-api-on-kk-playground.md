# How-To: Configure Kubernetes Gateway API

You can do this exercise either on the KodeKloud Kubernetes [Multi-Node Latest](https://kodekloud.com/playgrounds/playground-kubernetes-multi-node-latest) Playground or on a cluster [you have built yourself](https://github.com/kodekloudhub/certified-kubernetes-administrator-course/tree/master/kubeadm-clusters).

Gateway API is a new requirement for CKA exam starting in early 2025.

## What is Gateway API?

Gateway API is an extension to and enhancement of regular ingress. In order to use Gateway API, we must first install a Gateway API compatible ingress controller (note that this step should not be something you would have to do in CKA exam). Then we can utilise the new `gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1` APIs of Kubernetes to route and control traffic to services we've deployed in the cluster using more granular rules than was possible with ingress.

Gateway is not a "thing" in Kubernetes. Gateway API is only a set of Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) that defines a standard to which implementation providers must conform to.

These APIs were developed by the Kubernetes Networking Special Interest Group (SIG) to bring together all the disparate CRDs for routing and gateways from all the different implementations to make it easier to swap one implementation for another without having to replace all the routing and gateway resources in your cluster.

The actual implementations are third party, e.g. [Kong](https://docs.konghq.com/gateway/latest/), [Traefik](https://traefik.io/blog/getting-started-with-kubernetes-gateway-api-and-traefik/) and [Istio](https://istio.io/latest/docs/tasks/traffic-management/ingress/gateway-api/) to name but a few. Note that some of these providers have additional functionality which is not yet covered by the Gateway APIs. Work is ongoing between the SIG and the providers to extend the APIs to include these in a standardised way.


## What from this will be tested in the new CKA?

Following a question I put to Linux Foundation Training Support, I have put under each of the following sections the likelihood of there being questions on the procedures in that particular section. The highlight quote from their response is

> You are asking about "Use the Gateway API to manage Ingress traffic" in the domain "Servicing and Networking", weighted at 20%.
That provides about 24 minutes for the entire domain and up to 24 minutes for the single competency.<br/><br/>
SO if you think any of the tasks you mention would take MORE that that amount of time - then it is very unlikely that we would ask you to perform it.<br/><br/>The verb choice is "use".<br/>
We refer to the more narrow set of tasks using a specific technology or feature, which would typically exclude installing and configuring a gateway-compliant ingress controller from scratch.

Note that Gateway API is only *part* of the overall domain, therefore you would not get a whole 24 minutes worth of questions on it. This *suggests* you *may* get from zero to two questions specifically on Gateway API since there would need to be other questions from the overall domain competency, of which there are 6 sub-categories.

Now, let's proceed to configuring a gateway.

## Install Gateway API CRDs and a compatible ingress controller

This *will not* be required for the exam.

As mentioned above, there are several gateway controller implementations and you cannot be expected to learn all the configurations, nor are their websites allowed exam resources. You *should* be aware of the [GatewayClass](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/gateway/#api-kind-gateway-class) resource and its usage in selecting gateway controllers - similar to how `IngressClass` works.

We will use the Traefik (pronounced "traffic") ingress controller and use Helm to install it so as not to concern ourselves with the detail

1. Install the Gateway API Custom Resource Definitions

    These are *not included* in a default Kubernetes installation, so if not present we must install them.

    1. Check if already present

        ```
        kubectl get gatewayclass
        ```

        If you *do not* get an error, proceed to installing Helm, else...

    1. Install the CRDs

        ```
        kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/releases/download/v1.1.0/standard-install.yaml
        ```

1. Install Helm if it is not already present

    ```
    curl -fsSL -o get_helm.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/main/scripts/get-helm-3
    chmod 700 get_helm.sh
    ./get_helm.sh
    ```

1. Add Traefik repo to Helm

    ```
    helm repo add traefik https://traefik.github.io/charts
    helm repo update
    ```

1. Install Traefik and configure it to use NodePorts since we cannot provision a load balancer

    1. Create a namespace to install to

        ```
        kubectl create namespace traefik
        ```

    1. Create a custom values file to configure traefik the way we want it

        Save the following as `values.yaml`

        ```yaml
        providers:
          kubernetesIngress:
            enabled: false          # Disable classic ingress functionality
          kubernetesGateway:
            enabled: true           # Enable Gateway API functionality
        service:
          type: NodePort            # Create the service as NodePort (default is LoadBalancer)
        ports:
          web:
            port: 8000              # Port that the controller communicates with Gateway resources on
            nodePort: 30080         # Port for controller's NodePort service
        ```

    1. Install the controller with our custom settings

        ```
        helm install \
            --version 31.1.1 \
            --namespace traefik \
            --values values.yaml \
            traefik traefik/traefik
        ```

    The installation will also install a correctly configured `GatewayClass` resource to refer to the Traefik controller and a `Gateway` resource for the controller's internal use. You can inspect these with

    Documentation: [GatewayClass](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/gateway/#api-kind-gateway-class), [Gateway](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/gateway/#api-kind-gateway)

    ```
    kubectl get gatewayclass traefik -o yaml
    kubectl get gateway -n traefik traefik -o yaml
    ```

## Configure a gateway resource for our own routes

This *may* be required for the exam.

Documentation: [Gateway](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/gateway/#api-kind-gateway)

Here we create a `Gateway` resource that connects our ClusterIP services with the Gateway API. It will serve hosts in the `example.com` domain externally, and also allow connections from `HTTPRoute`s in any namespace.

1. Create a `Gateway` resource that will be used to route our traffic.

    This manifest must be applied in the same namespace in which we installed the controller. It links the Traefik ingress to the `GatewayClass` we just defined, and sets up a listener on port 8000

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
    kind: Gateway
    metadata:
      name: my-example-com-gateway
      namespace: traefik            # This is where Traefik is installed
    spec:
      gatewayClassName: traefik     # Use the gateway class created by traefik deployment (like ingressClass for traditional ingress)
      listeners:                    # Each entry in this list is knwon as a "section"
      - name: http                  # HTTPRoute uses this name to use this listener
        protocol: HTTP
        port: 8000                  # Port number we configured in values.yaml above
        hostname: "*.example.com"   # Domain we will serve (any hostname in this domain)
        allowedRoutes:
          namespaces:
            from: All               # Allow HTTPRoute from any namespace
    ```

## Create a deployment and expose it on the gateway

Configuring `HTTPRoute` definitely *will* be in the exam.

This is the Gateway API equivalent of defining an `Ingress` for a service. I would also expect it to appear in the next version of CKAD whenever this is announced.

1. Create a deployment and expose it

    ```
    kubectl create deployment nginx --image nginx
    kubectl expose deployment nginx --name nginx-service --port 80 --target-port 80
    ```

    Now we have a `Service` called `nginx-service` which we will expose via the gateway

1. Create an `HTTPRoute` to connect the service to the gateway

    Documentation: [HTTPRoute](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/gateway/#api-kind-httproute)

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
    kind: HTTPRoute
    metadata:
      name: nginx-route
      namespace: default
    spec:
      parentRefs:
      - name: my-example-com-gateway    # Name of the Gateway created above
        namespace: traefik              # Namespace where the above Gateway is deployed
        sectionName: http               # Specific named listener in the Gateway resource
      hostnames:
      - nginx.example.com               # Hostname for this service
      rules:                            # The rules are similar to Ingress
      - matches:
        - path:
            type: PathPrefix
            value: /
        backendRefs:                    # Can have more than one service to implement blue/green and canary.
        - name: nginx-service           # Service we created
          port: 80                      # and the port it listens on
    ```

1. Test it

    Do a curl to the NodePort of the controller. We must provide the host header here, since we do not have a DNS entry for `nginx.example.com`, and like ingress, the host header is used to determine which service should receive the request.

    ```
    curl -H "Host: nginx.example.com"  http://localhost:30080
    ```

    You should see the HTML for the nginx welcome page.

## Using a browser

Note that this only works if you [built your own cluster](https://github.com/kodekloudhub/certified-kubernetes-administrator-course/tree/master/kubeadm-clusters) using VMs on your laptop.

1. Determine the address of any of the cluster nodes. This was output at the end of `vagrant up`. Alternatively `vagrant ssh` to one of the cluster nodes and run

    ```bash
    echo $PRIMARY_IP
    ```

1. Edit your hosts file

    * Windows: `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` - open in notepad "As Administrator"
    * Mac: `/etc/hosts` - use `sudo vi`

1.  Add an entry for `nginx.example.com`

    Add this line replacing `<ip-address>` with the IP you determined in step 1, then save the file

    ```
    <ip-address> nginx.example.com
    ```

1. Browse the Gateway API node port:

    ```
    http://nginx.example.com:30080
    ```

## Traffic Switching

It *is possible* that a blue-green or canary configuration of `HTTPRoute` could appear in the exam.

Let's now create two services representing two versions of an application and demonstrate traffic switching. This technique allows us to manage blue/green and canary deployments.

1. Create and expose two deployments

    I have custom-built these deployments such that you can easily see the traffic switch without the need for a browser - as would be the case if I'd used the KodeKloud webapp-color image.

    <details>
    <summary>Expand YAML</summary>

    This manifest will create both deployments and both services

    ```yaml
    # ConfigMap that contains a really simple server written in bash.
    # It returns whatever is in environment variable MESSAGE when it receives a request.
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: ConfigMap
    metadata:
      name: echo-configmap
      namespace: default
    data:
      entrypoint.sh: |
        #!/bin/sh
        echo $MESSAGE > index.htm       # Message
        port=1111                       # Server Port
        # Run server...
        while true
        do
            { echo -ne "HTTP/1.0 200 OK\r\nContent-Length: $(wc -c <index.htm)\r\n\r\n"; cat index.htm; } | nc -l -p $port
        done

            configMap:
              name: echo-configmap
              defaultMode: 0755

    ---

    # Version 2 service
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Service
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: echo-v2
      name: echo-v2
      namespace: default
    spec:
      ports:
      - port: 80
        protocol: TCP
        targetPort: 1111
      selector:
        app: echo-v2
    ```
    </details>

1. Test the deployments

    ```
    kubectl run test --image wbitt/network-multitool
    # wait a few seconds till the pod is running
    kubectl exec -t test -- curl -s http://echo-v1
    kubectl exec -t test -- curl -s http://echo-v2
    kubectl delete pod test
    ```

1. Now create an `HTTPRoute` which includes *both* services

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
    kind: HTTPRoute
    metadata:
      name: echo-route
      namespace: default
    spec:
      parentRefs:
      - name: my-example-com-gateway    # Name of the Gateway created above
        namespace: traefik              # Namespace where the above Gateway is deployed
        sectionName: http               # Specific named listener in the Gateway resource
      hostnames:
      - echo.example.com                # Hostname for this service
      rules:                            # The rules are similar to Ingress
      - matches:
        - path:
            type: PathPrefix
            value: /
        backendRefs:                    # Add both versions of the service
        - name: echo-v1                 # V1 of service we created
          port: 80                      # and the port it listens on
          weight: 1                     # Equally weighted (take 50% traffic)
        - name: echo-v2                 # V2 of service we created
          port: 80                      # and the port it listens on
          weight: 1                     # Equally weighted (take 50% traffic)
    ```

1. Test it

    From controlplane to gateway's node port (again we must use host header):

    ```
    curl -s -H "Host: echo.example.com" http://localhost:30080
    ```

    You should now see the response alternate between `VERSION ONE` and `VERSION TWO`

    Try editing the `HTTPRoute` and setting the weight of one of the services to `2`. Now the traffic is a `2:1` ratio, so the version with a weighting of `2` should appear twice as frequently as the other.

    ```
    kubectl edit httproute echo-route
    ```

    What happens if you set one of them to zero?
