# Playground mini-FAQ

KodeKloud playgrounds are available to PRO subscribers and allow you to try things out in sandboxed playgrounds at no additional cost.

# Why can't I?

The majority of questions we handle on the forums are questions like "*Why can't I do X on this playground?*", normally in relation to the cloud playgrounds. These playgrounds have *limited* functionality and *restricted* access, i.e. it's not like you signed up for your own cloud account where you have full admin rights to do anything.

There are 3 main reasons

1. **Cost**. Many services are expensive to run. Also various configurations of services you are allowed to run like AWS EC2 where it's possible without constraints to launch a single instance that costs over 200 US dollars an hour! If we did not limit what can be done on a cost basis, the subscription price for PRO membership would have to be significantly increased!
1. **Security**. We need to protect against privilege escalations, e.g. ability to create new users with more permissions than the user you log in as, and unacceptable use of resources. Hence the IAM is quite tightly locked down. Tighter control on IAM also enforces the cost control described above, preventing users from launching costly resources.
1. **Manageability**. Adding a service that isn't currently offered in the playground is not a simple case of "just switch it on". We maintain a pool of cloud provider accounts which are recycled at the end of every session. For each supported service, there is a lot of work involved in:
    * Planning what parts of that service can be enabled from a cost point of view.
    * Security reviews on what we should permit to be done with that service, and that we do not leave open a privilege escalation door.
    * Creating the automation required to clean up all resources related to that service when your session ends.

    We are gradually increasing the number of offered services on each playground.

For each of the cloud playgrounds, the start page lists the services available and constraints on each. Read the entire page, don't just press the Launch Now button at the top. Pay particular attention to what it says there, including any service limitations where you will see a `View Limits` link. What you can do should include anything that covered by labs in any of our cloud courses, and a bit more.

Bottom line - if it's not listed, you can't launch it!

# Kubernetes Clusters

Also a popular topic on the forums is "*I tried to launch an EKS/AKS/GKE cluster, but I got this permission error*". The permission errors are for the reasons stated in the previous paragraph. We have curated cluster builds that will work on the playgrounds. See [here](https://github.com/kodekloudhub/certified-kubernetes-administrator-course/tree/master/managed-clusters).

Note that `eksctl` is not supported on AWS playgrounds as it asserts IAM permissions that are not granted.

Also don't try to use terraform, CloudFormation, ARM templates etc that you find elsewhere on the Internet as they will almost certainly not work, again due to IAM restrictions.
