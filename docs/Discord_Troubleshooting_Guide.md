- Ensure that nobody else on your network is using Discord with multiple accounts simultaneously.

## Server Limitations:

### Expected Scenario:
If you've reached the maximum limit of 100 servers you can join, you might face issues joining more servers or managing your existing memberships.

### Troubleshooting Steps:
- Consider leaving servers you no longer actively participate in to make room for new ones.
- Get tips on organizing and prioritizing your server memberships based on your interests and activities within the community.

## VPN Considerations:

### Expected Scenario:
If you're experiencing connectivity issues due to VPN usage.

### Troubleshooting Steps:
